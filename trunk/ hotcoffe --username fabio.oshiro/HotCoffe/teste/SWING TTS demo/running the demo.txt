This much nicer SWING demo uses a second DLL, QuadTkns. 
QuadTkns duplicates exactly the same method getVoiceToken() method available in QuadTTS.dll
and is used here to allow non-procedural code and to work around some JNI parameters 
explained in the source code.

To launch the demo, open a command prompt and change to this directory.

Then, do the command:
(full physical path)java.exe SwingSapiTTS
